# Racial Geography of Boston's Public Transit
The Boston Globe once called Boston the most racist city in the US. This project
aims to figure out what that means for the cityâ€™s public transit system. I used
data from the American Community Survey and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority
to analyze how racial demographics can be used to predict how accessible the T
in the greater Boston area.
